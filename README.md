## ✨ Project Overview

**Nanodoroshi** is more than just a blog; it's a technical showcase of modern web engineering and premium UI design. It utilizes a Serverless architecture to provide a seamless, lightning-fast experience while maintaining a "Digital Archive" feel through sophisticated Glassmorphism and Neon-Cyber aesthetics.

### 🎨 Design Philosophy: Cyber-Minimalism
- **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Multi-layered backdrop blurs and saturations for a deep, holographic interface.
- **Neon Accents**: High-contrast Cyan and Magenta energy lines to guide user interaction.
- **Dynamic Digital Environment**: A responsive radial mesh background with a technical grid overlay.
- **Asymmetric Component Design**: Custom-engineered geometric UI components for a unique, tectonic feel.
