## 🚀 About ROSAE HUB
ROSAE HUB is a progressive web application (PWA) designed to bridge the gap between digital convenience and emotional connection. It is not just a chat app; it is a **digital sanctuary** where users can express themselves freely through a beautifully crafted, high-tech yet warm interface.

## 💎 Business Model
We believe in sustainable community growth balanced with premium experiences.

### 1. Freemium Foundation (Open Access)
*   **Community First**: Core features like real-time chatting, blogging, and image sharing are free for everyone.
*   **Ad-Free Experience**: We prioritize user immersion over intrusive advertisements.

### 2. CORE Membership (Pro Tier)
*   **Secret Channels**: Create private, encrypted spaces for intimate groups.
*   **High-Fidelity Voice**: Access to crystal-clear, low-latency voice streaming channels.
*   **Profile Customization**: Unlock animated avatars, exclusive badges, and profile themes.

### 3. Creator Economy (Roadmap)
*   **Fan Engagement**: Tools for creators to host exclusive sessions and content.
*   **Digital Goods**: A marketplace for user-created stickers and themes.

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Philosophy
Our design language, **"Emotional Tech,"** aims to make technology feel less like a machine and more like a companion.

### 1. Emotional Palette
*   **Soft Pink (#FFB6C1) & Warm White (#FFF5F7)**: Departing from the cold, dark aesthetics of traditional "tech" apps, we use a soft, blooming palette that evokes comfort and friendliness.
*   **Hot Pink (#FF69B4)**: Used sparingly for actions and highlights to provide a vibrant, energetic pulse.

### 2. Mobile-First & Fluid responsiveness
*   **Unified Experience**: Whether on a desktop or a smartphone, the experience remains consistent.
*   **Tactile Interactions**: Buttons and cards respond with subtle animations, giving a sense of physical touch and responsiveness.
*   **Accessible Layouts**: Critical controls are placed within the "thumb zone" for effortless mobile navigation.

### 3. Futuristic Minimalism
*   **Glassmorphism & Soft Shadows**: We use translucent layers and soft ambient shadows to create depth without clutter.
*   **Typography**: Clean, geometric fonts (Montserrat, Noto Sans KR) prioritize readability while maintaining a modern edge.
*   **Immersive Modals**: Settings and menus appear as clean, floating cards rather than intrusive full-screen blockades.
